That
how
they
all
came
start
jogging off
from
inn
one
fine
morning
just
before
May
on
laden
ponies
Bilbo
wearing
dark-green
hood
little
weather-stained
dark-green
cloak
borrowed
from
Dwalin
They
were
too
large 
for
him
and
he
looked
rather
comic
What
his
father
Bungo
would
have 
of
him
I
think
His
only
comfort
was
he
couldnâ€™t
be
mistaken
for
dwarf
as
he
had
no
beard
